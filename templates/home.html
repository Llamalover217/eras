      (44BCE-476CE)
    </p>

    <h3>A bit about the Classical Era:</h3>
    <p>
      The Classical Era is derived from the architecture of Ancient Greece and
      Ancient Rome. It was constructed in the 5th century BC in Greece and in
      the 3rd cenury AD in Rome. The era emphasised the column and pediment and
      evolved from timber origins. The style was revived many times over the
      years. During the Italin renaissance, architects worked to restore
      Classical Roman Architecture.

    <h3>Characteristics of the Classical Era:</h3>

      - Symmetry <br />
      - Columns <br />
      - Rectangular Windows <br />
      - Marble or some other attractive, durable stone
