      <h3>A bit about the Classical Era:</h3>
      <p>
        The Classical Era is derived from the architecture of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
        It was constructed in the 5th century BC in Greece and in the 3rd cenury AD in Rome.
        The era emphasised the column and pediment and evolved from timber origins. The style was
        revived many times over the years. During the Italin renaissance, architects worked to 
        restore Classical Roman Architecture.
